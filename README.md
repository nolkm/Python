# Python




This GitHub repository is dedicated to all of my Python projects, both school-related and side projects. Here, you will find a wide range of projects, ranging from simple scripts to more complex applications. All projects are organized by type and by project name, making it easy to locate the project you need. Each project includes a detailed description of what the project does and how it works, as well as the code and any associated resources. If you are looking for inspiration or just want to learn more about Python, this repository is a great place to start.
